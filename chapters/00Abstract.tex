This project has been undertaken as a part of the master thesis towards the fulfillment of the degree of Master in Applied Computer Science at NTNU during the Spring 2023 semester with Siamak Khatami and Ahmad Hassanpour as the supervisor and co-supervisor respectively. The project is done in collaboration with industrial partner Mohn Technology which is a firm based in Bergen, Norway. They develop next generation underwater technology, and focus on research, fisheries and aquaculture. Classification of fish species using smart solutions was the motivation for this project. This area of research is beneficial for marine biologists, fish farmers and aquaculture. The project aims to use deep learning models for classification of fish species in freshwater environments such as rivers, streams, and lakes. Few different kind of models have been trained and the results are compared and discussed in the later chapters. The project can be extended further to incorporate more species and thus have more classes in the dataset for classification models to work effectively.    \\
