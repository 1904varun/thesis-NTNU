# thesis-NTNU

An NTNU thesis LaTeX document class for bachelor, master, and PhD theses.

This is _work in progress_. The goal is to substitute older more specialised templates like https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/bachelor-thesis-NTNU and https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/master-theses-NTNU and provide a single template for theses at all study levels.

Testers welcome!
