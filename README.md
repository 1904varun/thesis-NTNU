# thesis-NTNU

An NTNU thesis LaTeX document class for bachelor, master, and PhD theses.

This is _work in progress_. The goal is to substitute older more specialised templates like https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/bachelor-thesis-NTNU and https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/master-theses-NTNU and provide a single template for theses at all study levels.

Testers welcome!

## Setting up

You can use the template with [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com), and you are strongly encouraged to do so. The alternative is to install local copy of LaTeX on your laptop (not adviced, huge, difficult, and you need to maintain it yourself).

There are two ways for setting up the [**Overleaf**](http://overleaf.com) project with the template:
* Use the .zip copy and upload.
* Fork the the COPCSE repo so that you have your own files to edit.

You should **fork** the COPCSE repo so that you have your own files to edit and you can always merge with the upstream changes to the template, in case the template is updated.
